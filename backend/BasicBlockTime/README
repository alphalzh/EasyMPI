BasicBlockTime backend

This backend requires an alternative compilation of the LLVM PASS to add
time stamps to every basic block.  While seemingly desirable, this
significantly increases the runtime overhead and most blocks show low
times.  Most blocks have a long tail from context switches and other
exceptional events.
